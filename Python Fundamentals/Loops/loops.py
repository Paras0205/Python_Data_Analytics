# A loop repeats work so you don’t have to write the same code again and again.
# For example, instead of printing numbers 1 to 5 manually, you can use a loop.

# Example:

# python
# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i)

for loop
Use a for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat something,
or when you want to go through items in a sequence like a list, string, or range

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while loop
Use a while loop when you want repetition to continue until a condition becomes false.

Example:

python
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1    

break
break is used to stop a loop early when a condition is met.

Example:

python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)

continue
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

Example:

python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)

Nested loops
A nested loop means one loop inside another.

Example:

python
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 3):
        print(i, j)


Imp loops pattern

1.Accumulator Pattern (SUM / TOTAL)
Used when:
    You need total
    You need combined value

total = 0
for x in data:
    total += x   
    
Key idea:
    Variable outside loop, update inside loop


2.Counter Pattern (COUNT)
Used when:
    Counting items that match a condition

count = 0
for x in data:
    if x > 100:
        count += 1
        

3.Filter Pattern (SELECT)
Used when:
    Printing or storing specific items

for x in data:
    if x > 100:
        print(x)


4.Search Pattern (FIND)
Used when:
    Checking if something exists

found = False
for x in data:
    if x == target:
        found = True
